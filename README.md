### Personal Intro
#### I am just a average boy who was not good with technologies at all, touched pc for the first time to play GTA at arcade game store & got interest with infosec after searching Call Of Duty crack on internet

#### After seeing all the cool stuff of InfoSec, I start dreaming to become a Hacker. Passed through some useless coursed and random youtube videos. Everyone was telling hold on boy, you even don't know how to shut down your windows 8 machine, Hacking is not for you go and do something less technical
