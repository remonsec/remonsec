### Personal Intro
##### I am just a average boy who was not good with technologies at all, touched pc for the first time to play GTA at arcade game store & got interest with infosec after searching Call Of Duty crack on internet

</br>

</br>

##### After seeing all the cool stuff of InfoSec, I start dreaming to become a Hacker. passed through some useless coursed and random youtube videos. Everyone was telling, Hold on boy you even don't know how to shut down your windows 8 machine. Hacking is not for you. go and do something less technical
